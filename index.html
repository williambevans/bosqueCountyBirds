        <h6>Calamospiza melanocorys</h6>
    </a>
    <p>According to Partners in Flight's Landbird Conservation Plan (2016), this species has a continental decline of

        certain agricultural lands that include grain sorghum. Short grasses include sideoats and blue gramas, sand
        dropseed, prairie junegrass (Koeleria), buffalograss also with patches of bluestem and other mid- grass species.
        This bunting will frequent smaller patches of grasses or disturbed patches of grasses including rural yards. It
        also uses weedy fields surrounding playas. This species avoids urban areas and cotton fields.

    <a title="want to know more?"
        href="https://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/wildlife_diversity/texas_nature_trackers/amphibian_watch/amphibian_species/">
        <h6>Charadrius melodus</h6>
    </a>
    <p>Beaches, sandflats, and dunes along Gulf Coast beaches and adjacent offshore islands. Also spoil islands in the
        Intracoastal Waterway. Based on the November 30, 1992 Section 6 Job No. 9.1, Piping Plover and Snowy Plover
        Winter Habitat Status Survey, algal flats appear to be the highest quality habitat. Some of the most important
        aspects of algal flats are their relative inaccessibility and their continuous availability throughout all tidal
        conditions. Sand flats often appear to be preferred over algal flats when both are available, but large portions
        of sand flats along the Texas coast are available only during low-very low tides and are often completely
        unavailable during extreme high tides or strong north winds. Beaches appear to serve as a secondary habitat to
        the flats associated with the primary bays, lagoons, and inter-island passes. Beaches are rarely used on the
        southern Texas coast, where bayside habitat is always available, and are abandoned as bayside habitats become
        available on the central and northern coast. However, beaches are probably a vital habitat along the central and
        northern coast (i.e. north of Padre Island) during periods of extreme high tides that cover the flats. Optimal
        site characteristics appear to be large in area, sparsely vegetated, continuously available or in close
        proximity to secondary habitat, and with limited human disturbance.

    <h3>Rufa Red Knot</h3>
    <a title="want to know more?"
        href="https://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/wildlife_diversity/texas_nature_trackers/amphibian_watch/amphibian_species/">
        <h6>Calidris canutus rufa</h6>
    </a>
    <p>Red knots migrate long distances in flocks northward through the contiguous United States mainly April-June,
        southward July-October. A small plump-bodied, short-necked shorebird that in breeding plumage, typically held
        from May through August, is a distinctive and unique pottery orange color. Its bill is dark, straight and,
        relative to other shorebirds, short-to-medium in length. After molting in late summer, this species is in a drab
        gray-and-white non-breeding plumage, typically held from September through April. In the non-breeding plumage,
        the knot might be confused with the omnipresent Sanderling. During this plumage, look for the knot’s prominent
        pale eyebrow and whitish flanks with dark barring. The Red Knot prefers the shoreline of coast and bays and also
        uses mudflats during rare inland encounters. Primary prey items include coquina clam (Donax spp.) on beaches and
        dwarf surf clam (Mulinia lateralis) in bays, at least in the Laguna Madre. Wintering Range includes- Aransas,
        Brazoria, Calhoun, Cameron, Chambers, Galveston, Jefferson, Kennedy, Kleberg, Matagorda, Nueces, San Patricio,
        and Willacy. Habitat: Primarily seacoasts on tidal flats and beaches, herbaceous wetland, and Tidal flat/shore.

    <p>Prefers freshwater marshes, sloughs, and irrigated rice fields, but will attend brackish and saltwater habitats;
        currently confined to near-coastal rookeries in so-called hog-wallow prairies. Nests in marshes, in low trees,
        on the ground in bulrushes or reeds, or on floating mats.
